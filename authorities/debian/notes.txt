Debian Cryptographic Authorities
--------------------------------

Debian CD signing keys come from https://www.debian.org/CD/verify

I've only included the active stable CD signing key here.

I'm also only including signing keys from the current debian stable
distribution (jessie) and its security updates.

In the future, we'll want to include debian unstable, testing,
oldstable, etc.
