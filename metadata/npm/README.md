Included are two samples from a popular npm package (angularjs).
The first is the 'package.json' metadata, which includes
dependencies, documentation links, attribution, and licensing.
The second is the 'shrinkwrap' metadata, which attempts to
generate a frozen dependency list so that the build
is deterministic.
