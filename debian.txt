Notes about Debian package signing infrastructure
=================================================

There are two things signed by commonly-relied-upon cryptographic
authorities within debian:

 * installer ISOs (CD images)
 * APT archives


CD images
---------

The Installer ISOs can be found here:

  https://www.debian.org/releases/jessie/debian-installer/

For a given release, you can find them here:

  http://cdimage.debian.org/debian-cd/8.2.0/amd64/iso-cd/

The authority signs several files that each contain cryptographic
digests of a specific release.  You can find examples of these files
in metadata/debian/cdimage/.

So each signature signs off on a set of images.  the images themselves
are identified only by their file names, like
debian-8.2.0-amd64-netinst.iso or debian-8.2.0-amd64-CD-9.iso.  This
can be broken out into $distro-$version-$architecture-$cdtype.iso.

APT archives
------------

(see overview in README.md)

There are multiple cryptographic signatures over a top-level Release
file, found in a single Release.gpg.

These signatures come may from online signing keys or from offline
signing keys, and any key can sign any Release file (if you have
multiple repository sources, there is no binding between them).

Weirdnesses
-----------

 * There is no common or automated CD Image verification step that i'm
   aware of, and the message signatures aren't linked directly from
   the visible download page.  Most folks probably never verify their
   CD images.

 * APT doesn't let the user require a certain key or set of keys to be
   used with a certain source.  All keys can create valid signatures
   for all sources.

 * APT signature verification is weakest-link.  If only one signature
   shows up correct, then the file is accepted as legitimate.

 * it's not clear how timing information works: signatures have
   timestamps, but Release also has a Date: field.  Does APT reject
   updates that are older than its most recent fetch?

 * It's not clear what benefit some of the authorities are.  why do we
   need both the jessie-release-key and the jessie-automatic-key, for
   example?
